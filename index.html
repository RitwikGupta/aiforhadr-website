                <p>Humanitarian crises from disease outbreak to war to oppression against disadvantaged groups have threatened people and their communities throughout history. Natural disasters are a single, extreme example of such crises. In the wake of hurricanes, earthquakes, and other such crises, people have ceaselessly sought ways &mdash; often harnessing innovation &mdash; to provide assistance to victims after disasters have struck.</p>
                <p>Through this workshop, we intend to establish meaningful dialogue between the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response (HADR) communities. By the end of the workshop, the NeurIPS research community can learn the practical challenges of aiding those in crisis, while the HADR community can get to know the state of art and practice in AI. We seek to establish a pipeline of transitioning the research created by the NeurIPS community to real-world humanitarian issues. We believe such an endeavor is possible due to recent successes in applying techniques from various AI and Machine Learning (ML) disciplines to HADR.</p>

                    <p>Robotics has been an invaluable tool for providing search and rescue, clean-up, and planning capabilities in areas in which it is dangerous or impossible for humans to get to. The use cases for AI in HADR are numerous. Beyond the examples below, AI can be applied to disaster logistics, building damage assessment, information dissemination, and many use cases that are yet to be discovered.</p>

                <h3>SnakeBot</h3>
                <p>The recent Mexico City earthquakes impacted an area with high population density and many multiple-story buildings. In order to comb through the rubble in a time span in which stranded humans could survive, rescuers deployed robots such as the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/cmu-snake-robot-mexico-earthquake">SnakeBot</a>. While controlled manually for this event, the SnakeBot presented immense promise as an autonomous platform for search and rescue.</p>

                <h3>Computer Vision</h3>
                <p>Computer vision can be used to automatically assess building damage rapidly across massive areas. Knowing how much damage there is, even in remote areas, within 24-48 hours of a disaster is critical to declare states of emergency. Typically, humans have to be physically inserted or teams of humans have to be deployed with UAVs to assess building damage. With the increased availability of remote imagery and advanced computer vision techniques, it was possible to <a href="https://blog.crowdai.com/assessing-damage-after-the-storm/">assess damage after Hurricane Michael within minutes</a> after images were available.</p>
